
A certain bank is creating a model whether an applicant will be approved or not in their loan application based on the applicantâ€™s age (Age), income (Income), and credit card average spending (CCAvg). The dependent variable (Personal Loan) is encoded as 0 or 1 (0-loan not approved, 1-approved). The bank officer is planning to run a Discriminant Analysis in a data set consisting of 5,000 individuals based on bank records.
